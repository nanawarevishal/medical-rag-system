It is hard for the body to use carbohydrates and fats.  The main marker of diabetes is high blood sugar ('glucose'). Your blood sugar is kept in check by insulin. Insulin is a hormone that is made in the pancreas. When you get diabetes, it is related to two things:\n- The amount of insulin your body makes\n- How well your body's cells use insulin.\nThere are two different types of diabetes: type 1 and type 2.  Only about 5% of people have type 1. Type 1 used to be called other names ('juvenile diabetes', 'insulin-dependent diabetes').  In type 1, the pancreas does not make insulin. It usually starts as a child or teen. Type 2 often starts after age 40.  Type 2 used to be called other names too ('adult-onset diabetes'). Obese teens can also get type 2.  In type 2, your pancreas makes insulin. But, it does not make enough insulin. Or, your body cannot use the insulin as well.  This often happens when you are obese. At first, your body will make more insulin to try to keep up. But, when the body can no longer keep up, diabetes comes on. Type 2 often runs in families.",

You need your kidneys to get rid of waste products.\nYou are also more likely to get heart disease. Your heart has arteries that carry blood to the rest of your body. The trouble comes on when your arteries get narrow (called 'atherosclerosis'). Then, blood does not flow well to parts of the body. This can happen in different parts of the body: heart, brain, legs.
